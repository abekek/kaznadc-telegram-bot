Telegram Bot, which will help Kazakhstan National Doping Committee to track their athletes.

Currently, KazNADC does not have any professional tools to gather this information and athletes do not have any tools to always provide it. Consequently, KazNADC ban those athletes, who stop providing any information and as a result, they cannot participate in Olympic Games. Moreover, not many athletes are acquainted with the list of forbidden substances, so they suffer from KazNADCâ€™s punishment actions.

## Files and Code
There is one file which I didn't include in this repository, because it's a Certificate file written in .json. Also, in some lines of code there are no String values because they represent private TOKENs and Certificates.

## Hosting
Bot has not been hosted yet, so if you will want to test it, text me!
I'm planning to host it on Heroku
